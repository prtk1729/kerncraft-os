#### Intro and Setup

- `arm` language will give the power to interact with low level machine/assembly language
- `Billions` of devices are written in `assembly language`
= I have to focus on 
    - `Simnple contructs`
    - `Basics operations`
    - `Loop and Branches`
    - `CPU Emulator`
    - `Syntax for any arm processor`
    - Underlying principles apply to `any assemble lang`

#### Using CPULator to check `registers` and `memory updates` and `flags`, `step-into etc operations`
